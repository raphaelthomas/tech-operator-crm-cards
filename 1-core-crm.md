# 💳 Tech Operator Generic CRM Card

This pocket card incorporates core CRM principles and selected IT-focused tools (**FOR-DEC, BAT, Sterile Cockpit, PACE, IMSAFE**).

## 🤝 CORE PILLARS & PRINCIPLES

| 🎯 **CRM CORE** | **ACTIONABLE PRINCIPLES** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Situational Awareness (SA)** | ➡️ **Know Your Status:** What is the current system state, the impact, and the available resources? **Call out *any* deviation**. |
| | 🔄 **10 for 10 Check:** Use a 10-second pause every 10 minutes to reset SA: **Main Problem? Facts? Team? Plan\! Distribute\! Queries?\!** |
| **2. Communication** | 🗣️ **Clear & Direct:** Speak precisely. **Use full names** for services/servers. Avoid ambiguity. |
| | 🤝 **Close the Loop:** Sender/Receiver confirmation: **Said → Heard → Understood → Done**. Address people by name/function. |
| **3. Assertiveness & Teamwork** | 📢 **Speak Up:** If you see an error or have a concern, **state it clearly and calmly**. Don't assume the lead sees everything. |
| | 🚀 **PACE Ladder:** A structured way to challenge an action: **P**robe (Question) → **A**lert (Concern) → **C**hallenge (Demand Stop) → **E**mergency (Act to Stop). |
| **4. Leadership** | ⭐ **Flexible Lead:** The person with the **most expertise for the immediate crisis** may need to assume temporary leadership. **Lead by example, own the plan, and listen**. |

## 🟢 PERSONAL READINESS CHECK

| 🛑 **IMSAFE** (Self-Assessment) | **AM I FIT FOR DUTY?** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **I**llness | Do I have a cold, headache, or other ailment affecting my focus? |
| **M**edication | Am I taking anything that impairs my judgment or causes drowsiness? |
| **S**tress | Am I worried, angry, or distracted? |
| **A**lcohol / **F**atigue | Am I rested and clear-headed (the **8-Hour Rule** applies\!)? |
| **E**motion | Am I in an emotionally stable state (overly frustrated or confident)? |

**Self-Care Action:** If the answer is "No" to any check, **demand a break or a handoff immediately.**


## 🛠️ CRITICAL ACTION FRAMEWORKS

| TOOL | PURPOSE & CHECKLIST |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FOR-DEC** | **Structured Decision Making** (Use for any high-impact choice):<br>1. **F**acts: Gather all current data.<br>2. **O**ptions: List possible solutions.<br>3. **R**isks & Benefits: Assess the impact of each.<br>4. **D**ecision: Select the best option.<br>5. **E**xecution: Implement the decision.<br>6. **C**heck & Control: Verify the result and adjust the plan. |
| **B.A.T.** | **Incident Handoff / Shift Change** (Transferring Control):<br>1. **B**ackground: What happened? What have we tried? (History)<br>2. **A**ction: What is the current status? What is running *now*? (Current State)<br>3. **T**asks: What are the next planned steps? Who is responsible? (Future Plan) |
| **Sterile Cockpit** | **Focus Management** (Aviation Rule): **Restrict all conversation to only essential tasks** during critical phases (e.g., executing production changes, major restarts). **Silence all non-essential comms.** |

## 🚨 ERROR PREVENTION & MITIGATION

| Rule | Action / Instruction |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The 3-WAY Rule** | **Critical Execution Verification** (Extension of Double Check):<br>1. **Say It:** Verbalize the exact command/action.<br>2. **Point It:** Point to the code/screen element.<br>3. **Do It:** Execute the action only after monitor confirmation. |
| **Double Check** | **Apply the Two-Person Rule** (Four-eye principle) for any irreversible or production-critical action (e.g., Purge, Delete, Config Change). |
| **The 8-Hour Rule** | **Fatigue Mitigation:** After **8 hours** of continuous critical incident work, **demand a mandatory break** or a full handoff to a fresh team. Cognitive functions degrade rapidly after this point. |
| **Role Clarity** | **Designated Roles:** In any major incident, explicitly name: **Incident Commander** (IC: owns plan/FOR-DEC), **Communicator** (Comms: external/status), and **Operator** (Ops: executes commands). **No one person handles all three.** |
| **Documentation Mandate** | **"Write It Down Now."** Live-document critical actions, commands, and outcomes in the incident journal **as they happen**. Don't rely on post-mortem memory. |
