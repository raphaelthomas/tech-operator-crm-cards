# 📝 Tech Operator Post Incident Review Card

## 📝 SYSTEMIC LEARNING

| 👥 **MANDATES & SETUP** | **ACTION / REMINDER** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **PIR Goal** | **System Improvement, not individual punishment.** Honesty is mandatory. |
| **Blameless Culture** | Facilitator Rule: **Shut down** all blame. Rephrase accusations: **"What led us to believe this action was the correct choice at the time?"** |
| **Data First** | **Fact-check:** Start with the validated timeline. **Ignore speculation.** |
| **PIR Start** | **Establish Chronology:** For every key event, log: **Time (Z), Observation (System), Action (Human).** |

## 🛠️ ANALYSIS TOOLBOX

| Tool | Purpose | How to Apply |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Modified 5 Whys** | **Drive past human error** to the systemic flaw. | Start with the Active Failure and ask **"Why?"** repeatedly, stopping only when the answer is a **systemic or procedural gap** (e.g., lack of automation, staffing pressure). |
| **Latent Condition Search** | **Check 4 Ps:** Ensure analysis covers all dimensions of failure:<br>1. **Procedures** (Runbook/Policy)<br>2. **People** (Training/Staffing/Comms)<br>3. **Plant/Product** (Tooling/Monitoring/Infra)<br>4. **Priorities** (Org. Pressure/Tradeoffs) |

## 📝 PIR Pocket Card: Learning & Action

| 🟢 **SYSTEMIC OUTCOMES** | **REQUIREMENT** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mandate** | **Human error is a symptom, not a cause.** Do not stop the investigation at the person. |
| **Actionable Outcomes** | List every layer of defense that **should have caught the incident** but failed (e.g., Monitoring, Automated Testing, Runbook). |
| **Categorization** | Assign all actions a type: **Code/Config Fix, Documentation Update, Automation/Tooling, Training/Procedure Change.** (Prioritize the last two). |
| **SMART Follow-up** | All actions must be **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**elevant, and **T**ime-bound. Vague actions ("Be more careful") are rejected. |
| **Ownership** | Every action must have a single **named owner** and a **due date** logged in a tracking system. |
| **Verification Loop** | Before closing an action item, **verify the fix** (e.g., by simulating the failure or running a specific test). |
