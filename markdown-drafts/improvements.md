This is an excellent step. The STELLA Report and the principles of Resilience Engineering (or Safety-II) are about understanding **Work-As-Done (WAD)** versus **Work-As-Imagined (WAI)**.

The core learning is that human operators are not a liability; they are the **system's most flexible defense**. They succeed by constantly adapting to system complexity. Our cards need to incorporate methods for finding, valuing, and institutionalizing these local adaptations (WAD).

Here are the key learnings and concrete tools we can incorporate into your existing cards:

## 💡 STELLA Learnings for Pocket Cards

### 1. Post-Incident Review (PIR) Card (Maximum Impact)

The PIR card is where these concepts have the strongest operational application. The goal shifts from explaining failure to explaining **how success was maintained for so long.**

| Concept | Actionable Incorporation | Card Section |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Work-As-Done (WAD) Focus** | **The "Successful Deviations" Mandate:** Before investigating the failure, investigate the last 10 successful deployments/incidents. Ask: **"What did the operator *actually* do that was not in the runbook?"** (Identifying the necessary "local patches"). | **PIR Analysis Toolbox** |
| **Finding WAD/WAI Gaps** | **The "Procedure vs. Reality" Check:** Mandate asking: "What part of the procedure (WAI) did the operator have to skip, change, or invent (WAD) to make progress?" This pinpoints usability flaws. | **PIR Systemic Weakness** |
| **Trusting the Operator** | **"Experience is a Resource":** A specific mandate to interview the operator not just on *what* they did, but *why* they thought it was the right time/place to do it. | **PIR Blameless Culture** |

### 2. Deployment/Rollout Safety Card

This card needs to acknowledge that the strict plan (**WAI**) will likely fail due to environmental variables.

| Concept | Actionable Incorporation | Card Section |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational Experience** | **Briefing (AIM-C) Refinement:** Add a mandatory check: **"Local Knowledge Check: Did the lead operator share any known environmental quirks or 'gotchas' not documented in the runbook?"** | **Step 1: BRIEFING** |
| **Capture Success** | **Post-Execution Capture:** Add a step to capture the actual commands used (even if slightly different from the runbook) and the successful metrics for documentation update. | **Step 4: IMMEDIATE FAILURE PROTOCOL** (Modify to include Success) |

### 3. Solo Operator / Support Card

These cards focus on the individual operator's cognitive burden, making it crucial to validate their local knowledge and judgment.

| Concept | Actionable Incorporation | Card Section |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Valuing Local Knowledge** | **Trust Your Gut/Experience (Formalized):** Add a positive reinforcement: **"If your experience conflicts with the documentation, PAUSE and consult an SME. Your internal alarm (WAD) is a valid data point."** | **Diagnosis Strategy** |
| **WAD Documentation** | **Refine Documentation Mandate:** Change the instruction from "Record commands" to **"Record the command and the reason you chose it (especially if it deviates from the runbook)."** (Capturing the operator's mental model). | **Documentation Mandate** |

These additions transform the cards from being simple regulatory checklists into powerful **resilience tools** that actively seek out and value the expertise of the people doing the actual work.
